TAGA Features:
=============================

  Deployment:
  -----------
  1. Unix/Linux shell script-based capabilities reduce dependencies simplifying deployment
  2. Auto Self Replication
  3. Auto Key Generation and Distribution

  Run-time:
  -----------
  1. Auto Configuration of Interface Names and Host Names (via targetList)
  2. Auto Determination of Network Environment and Environment based Auto Configuration
  3. Auto Network Node Time Synchronization Verification
  4. Auto Distribution of (updates to) Configuration
  5. Auto File Collection and Process Cleanup
  6. Auto Generation of Analytical Artifacts
  7. Auto resource utilization monitor and display
  8. Distributed and Parallel Processing provides for timely and robust data generation and collection
  9. Policy-Based Management (e.g. Log Mgt and Network Overhead Control) (Note1)
  10. Auto Fault Detection and Recovery (Condition-based Automatic Node and Network-wide Reboots) 
         - this automatically pinpoints network faults 
         - this allows for *unmanned* and *24x7* testing 
         - allows for user-configurable blacklist handling
  11. TAGA Convergence utility
         - simplifies determination of network stability, usability and test scenario repeatability
  12. Precise synchronization of traffic generation initiation
  13. Six levels of run-time output - user specified

  Extendability:
  -----------
  1. Start of Test (Traffic), Middle of Test (Traffic), and End of Run Test (Traffic) Test Shells Provided
  2. TAGA Provided Samples include Pub/Sub implementation and File Input/output in Python and C languages 

  Scalability:
  -----------
  1. TAGA Display scales automatically based on node count and duration 
  2. TAGA 'Run and Mon' Utility scales automatically based on target list update 
  3. TAGA Utility scales well by limiting configuration changes to two primary configuration 
     files (config, targetList.sh) and a few key params (timer delays, traffic rates/counts, etc)
  4. Round-robin and staggered starts help avoid traffic overload during large network tests

  Ease of Use:
  -----------
  1. Basic Network Health Check at a single commmand (run or mon)
  2. Tailorability of Displays
  3. Standardized INFO, WARN, and ALARM tags simplify filtering (Note1)
  4. "Go Remote" "Probe" "Prep" "TimeTimer" and other time saving utilities
  5. Human Readable and Tailorable Timestamps
  6. Multiple Interfaces per Host supported (Note1)

  Other:
  -----------
  1. IBOA Auto Alias Utility is bundled with the TAGA Framework Release
      - enables fast and automatic creation of individual and group (team) specialized aliases
          - smart aliases increase workflow and productivity by reducing keystrokes and input errors
          - smart aliases provide for more efficient operations and reduced cycle times 
      - enables fast filter creation for enhanced data analysis
      - fosters teamwork, collaboration, and communication
  2. Sample Filters and other extensions available upon request to info@iboa.us

=============================
TAGA Future Extensions:
=============================

  1. More capable Automated Test Analytic Artifact Generation (ATAAG) (TM pending) (IBOA AI filters).
  2. Complete implementation of items identified by Note1 (Initially/Partially supported items).
  3. Additional protocol support (options to UDP, TCP, SSH, etc.)
  4. Scalability and Performance Improvements
  5. IPv6 Support

=============================
TAGA System Requirements:
=============================

  1. Linux-like operating environment
  2. Bash or equivalent shell (for full capabilities)
  3. One-time set-up of security-related configs enabling automatic behavior
  4. libssh (ssh) and libpcap (tcpdump) or similar/equivalent libraries
  6. mgen, iperf, or similar/equivalent traffic generation engines
  7. IPv4-based network addressing scheme
